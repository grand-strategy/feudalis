# `feudalis`

Simplified model of human systems specifically based on the feudal era as seen
in medieval Europe.

This model takes heavy inspiration from the Crusader Kings series games by
Paradox Interactive.


## Principal items

**Characters**: mostly defined by their traits and decisions. Each character
can potentially become landed and thus a ruler of a government.

**Dynasties**: characters can make their families into notable dynasties.

**Governments**: separate entities influencing both characters and land.

**Counties**: internal workings of each geographical division include: crude
population simulation including resource extraction and production of goods,
special structures, presence of military units, and more.


## Physical context

The model breaks the world down into a fixed set of counties. There exist
additional fixed settlement locations that exist within counties. Physical
entities like characters define their location based on either just the county
or more specifically a city they're currently in.
